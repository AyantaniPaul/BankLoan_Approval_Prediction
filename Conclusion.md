# **`Conclusion`**

After comparing the four models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score, roc-auc curve and precision-recall curve we can finally conclude that Random Forest is the best amongst the four models with 
- Accuracy of 98%.
- Precision of 82.35%,
- Recall of 97.67%
- F1 Score of 0.893617,
- ROC-AUC Score of 0.9959 and,
- Precision-Recall curve having a AUC score of 0.97.

This concludes that the Random Forest Classifier correctly classifies 98% of the overall predictions. \\
Out of all the loans that was predicted to be approved by the model, only approximately 82% were actually approved. \\
Out of all the loans that have been actually approved, the model could predict only 97.67% of them. \\
The ROC-AUC Score for Random Forest Classifier is 0.9959 , which means that approximately 99.59% of the time the model can distinguish between the two classes. \\
