# BankLoan_Approval_Prediction
## Goal
The aim of this project is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans. The classification tool- Logistic Regression is used to fit to the BankLoan dataset obtained from Kaggle.
### Business Problem
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success.This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
